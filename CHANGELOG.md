## [0.1.0] - 2026-06

Initial release of `koptim` (K-Optimizers).

### Added
- `Adafusion` — conv-aware factored optimizer:
  - Factored second moment with the **conv-aware fix** (reshape 4-D conv kernels
    to 2-D before factoring → near-zero state vs ~0.4 B/param for the last-dims
    variant on a diffusion UNet).
  - Optional first-moment momentum in `float32` / `bfloat16` / `int8`
    (`momentum_dtype`). bf16 momentum matches fp32 quality at half the state.
  - bf16-correct weight updates via stochastic rounding (no buffer) or Kahan.
  - Optional `cautious` masking, `decay_rate` (HF Adafactor schedule),
    `clip_threshold`, decoupled `weight_decay`.
  - `compile=True` routes the factored core through `torch.compile`
    (~+30% on large 2-D weights).
- `Muon` — orthogonalized-momentum (Newton-Schulz) with an AdamW fallback for
  1-D params, auto-routed by rank; `momentum_dtype` for bf16 momentum.
- Tests for both optimizers.
